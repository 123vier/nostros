This can be useful in environments where censorship or surveillance is an issue.\n\n\nIt is important to note that relays can also be used for malicious purposes, such as sniffing or censoring network traffic.\n\n\nTherefore, it is important to carefully evaluate the use of relays and consider appropriate security measures to protect privacy and network security.",

To achieve the goal of a decentralized network, clients (e.g., Nostros) and relays (content servers) should actively cooperate. The Nostros resilience mode seeks first to raise awareness of this among users, and second to test new patterns and methods to improve the resilience of the network.\nA working implementation for this will soon be applied in Nostros.",
      "resilienceCategories": "Resilience exposure",
      "resilienceCategoriesDescription": "An initial approach that Nostros is testing is to randomly calculate (based on received contact events) which relays are most balanced. This tries to avoid both relays with too many events (centralization) and relays with almost no events (battery discharge).\n\nThe goal is to create a list of 5 relays that cover all contacts. However, if this is not possible, Nostros will search among other relays and warn the user about it.",
